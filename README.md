# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ashley. I'm an industrial designer turned software developer residing in Portland, Maine.
I also occasionally take freelance work as a graphic designer and artist.

The internet has been incredibly helpful in my growth. Between unlimited knowledge and friendly individuals, it has opened doors for me and spurred my desire to give back to the same community. As a result, I have an interest in making the internet available to all groups of people and am open to volunteering my time to make open-source projects more web accessible.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, restoration yoga, and caring for my houseplants. 
I believe in keeping my life simple and leaving time for self care.
